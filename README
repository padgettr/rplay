Simple command line live radio player
-----------------------------------------

This script uses ffplay to play live radio streams, including streams from an mpd server. It was designed to be used on a raspberry pi embedded into an old WQ-T354 radio, via a web interface. For mpd streams it will wait for the stream to start, and will wait after the stream ends until a stop command is issued. This makes it suitable for autostarting from systemd or other init for a mpd stream player.
It can also detect (with optional curl and jq packages) local icecast streams and play (exec rplay.sh with no args to show detected stations).

Requires
--------
bash
ffmpeg (ffplay)
awk
mpc
curl (optional)
jq (optional)

Install
-------
Read through the bash script files and decide if this does what you want it to! Please note it is only designed as a live radio player.
Copy the script rplay.sh to /usr/local/bin or edit and adjust the PRESET array and other setup parameters (e.g. ICECAST_SERVER_JSON_URL, FILTER_PRESET) as required.

Usage
-----
Run rplay.sh help for usage, detected icecast streams and presets.

For BBC streams (UK only), the player will attempt to play the high quality 320kb/s aac streams by default. Edit the script to change the stream quality.
Tested on Arch linux, Void linux(arm) and Arch Linux|ARM (on a raspberry PI 2, 3 and 4) only.
