Simple command line live radio player
-----------------------------------------

This script uses ffplay to play live radio streams, including streams from an mpd server. It was designed to be used on a raspberry pi embedded into an old WQ-T354 radio, via a web interface or ssh. For mpd streams it will wait for the stream to start, and will wait after the stream ends until a stop command is issued. This makes it suitable for autostarting from systemd or other init for a mpd stream player.

Requires
--------
bash
ffmpeg (ffplay)
awk
mpc

Install
-------
Read through the bash script files and decide if this does what you want it to! Please note it is only designed as a live radio player.
Copy the script rplay.sh to /usr/local/bin or edit and adjust the PRESET array as required.

Usage
-----
Run rplay.sh help for usage and presets.

By default, the player will attempt to play the high quality 320kb/s aac streams from BBC. Edit the script to change the stream quality.
Tested on Arch linux and Arch Linux|ARM (on a raspberry PI 2, 3 and 4) only.
